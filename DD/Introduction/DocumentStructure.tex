\section{Document Structure}
This document is divided into 6 sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{Introduction} \\
A brief introduction of the design document.

\item \underline{Architectural Design} \\
Here are shown the main architectural design choices about the structure of the System. In the High Level Architecture the System is described by means of a layered structure of four tiers; the Component view specifies the role of each component within the System and the interactions between them; the Physical Architecture is explained in the Deployment view, that illustrates the hardware and software architectural decisions; the Database view shows the database structure of the System; the Run-time view shows, with the use of sequence diagrams, how the previously described components interact between each other and how they perform the main functionalities of the System.

\item \underline{User Interface Design} \\
This chapter describes through Mock-Ups and UX diagrams the main User interfaces which are present in the clients.

\item \underline{Requirements Traceability} \\
In this section are presented the mapping between the requirements, stated in the RASD document, and the components of the System.

\item \underline{Implementation, Integration and Test Plan} \\
Here is presented the plan that describes how and in which order each component will be developed, and how each of them will be integrated with the others.

\item \underline{Effort Spent} \\
This section shows he total amount of hours spent by each collaborator for the editing of this document.
