\section{Document Structure}
This document is divided into 6 sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction:\\
A brief introduction of the design document.

\item Architectural Design:\\
Here are shown the main architectural design choices about the structure of the System. In the High Level Architecture the System is described with a layered structure of four tiers; in the Component view is specified the role of each component within the System and their interactions; the Physical Architecture is explained in the Deployment view, that illustrates the hardware and software architectural decisions; the Database view shows the database structure of the System; in the Run-time view is shown through sequence diagrams how the previously described components interact between each other and how they perform the main functionalities of the System.

\item User Interface Design:\\
This chapter explains the main User interfaces used in the client layer through Mock-Ups and UX diagrams.

\item Requirements Traceability:\\
In this section the mapping between the requirements, stated in the RASD document, and the components of the System are presented.

\item Implementation, Integration and Test Plan:\\
In this section in presented the plan that describes how and in which order each component will be developed and how each of them will be integrated with the others.

\item Effort Spent:\\
In this section is shown the total amount of hours spent by each component of this group to write the Design document.
