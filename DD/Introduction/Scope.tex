\section{Scope}
TrackMe is a system that provides three different services: Data4Help, AutomatedSOS and Track4Run.
Data4Help collects data of individuals through their smart watches or smart devices. The Users can visualize their health and location data through their mobile devices, while the Third Parties can access data in real time, after authorization, to monitor the location and health status of a single individual or a set of individuals in an anonymized way through a web application. They can receive periodical updates on targeted users and group request, and consult the data through useful statistics.
AutomatedSOS offers a personalized and non-intrusive SOS service. Based on the data collected by Data4Help, it detects anomalies in the health status of the individual and alerts the NHS, allowing the dispatch of an ambulance as soon as possible.
Track4Run is a service that allows the organization of local runs. Organizers can create a new run and set a customized path. Users can visualize the planned runs in detail and, if interested, enroll as participants. The service uses Data4Help data to show the position of the participants on a map, allowing other online users to follow the run live on their devices.
