The screens in red of the UX diagrams are the parts of the application that are always reachable from the bottom menu in the Mobile application and from the leftmost menu in the Web application. These screens are reachable from every page of the Mobile and Web application, except from the \textit{User login page}, \textit{Third Party login page} and the \textit{Create new account} screens.
