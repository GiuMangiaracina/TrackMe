\section{Scope}
The aim of the project is to develop a software-based application for the company TrackMe that
provides three different services: Data4Help, AutomatedSOS and Track4Run.
Data4Help collects data of individuals through smartwatches and similar devices. Registered users can
visualize their data through useful statistics, while third parties can access data, after authorization,
in real time to monitor the location and health status of a single individual, or a set of individuals in an
anonymized way.
AutomatedSOS offers a personalized and non-intrusive SOS service to  people. Based on the
data collected by Data4Help, it detects anomalies in the health status of the individual and alerts the NHS, allowing the dispatch of an ambulance as soon as possible.
Track4Run is a platform that allows the organization of local runs. Organizers can create a new run, setting a customized path and the related preferences. Users can visualize the planned runs in detail and enroll to them as participants if interested. The
service uses Data4Help data to show the position of the participants on a map, allowing all the online users to follow the run live on their devices.
