\section{Scope}
The aim of the project is to develop a software-based application for the company TrackMe that
provides three different services: Data4Help, AutomatedSOS and Track4Run.
Data4Help collects data of individuals through smartwaches and similar devices. Registered users can
visualize their data through useful statistics, while third parties can acces said data, after authorization,
in real time to monitor the location and health status of a single individual, or a set of individuals in an
anonymized way.
AutomatedSOS offers a personalized and non-intrusive SOS service to elderly people. Lying on the
data collected by Data4Help, it detects anomalies in the health status of the individual. When
necessary, the nearest emergency ward is alerted, allowing the dispatch of an ambulance as soon as
possible.
Track4Run is a platform that allows the organization of local runs. Users can create a new run, setting
a predeterminate path. Partecipants can enroll to the run and invite other users to join them. The
service uses Data4Help data to show the position of the partecipants on a map, allowing all the users
to follow the run live on their devices.
