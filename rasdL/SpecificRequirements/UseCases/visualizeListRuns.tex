 \subsection{Visualize the list of scheduled runs}
Into the page of \emph{Track4Run} a Registered user can perform a manual search specifying the characteristics (location range and minimum/maximum distance) of the runs that wants to visualize. Then the system will show both the lists of live and scheduled runs.
