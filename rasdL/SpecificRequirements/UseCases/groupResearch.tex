\subsection{Group Research}
The Third Party can make a request for anonymized data specifing the constraints of the group, the data that wants to retrieve and optionally the subscription mode with the interval time of updates. The anonymized group data are shown to the Third Party only if the privacy constraints are respected (i.e. there are at least 1000 users that match the specified constraints).

                                \item The \emph{Third Party} selects the Group section.
                                \item The \emph{Third Party} selects the "New Request" button.
                                \item The \emph{Third Party} specifies the group constraints (such as city or location, the age interval, gender, height and weight, that can be chosen optionally).
                                 \item The \emph{Third Party} selects the data that wants to retrieve and, if it has chosen the subscription mode, should also specify the interval time for the updates.
                                 \item Finally, the \emph{Third Party} sends the request, selecting the "Send" button.
                                 \item If the privacy constraints are respected, the System sends the requested anonymous data to the \emph{Third Party}.

                                            \item The \emph{Third Party} specified an impossible age/height/weight range.
                                            \item In subscription mode, the \emph{Third Party} hasn't specified an update interval time.
                                            \item The \emph{Third Party} hasn't specified the data that wants to retrieve.
    \end{enumerate}
    										If one of these problems occur, the System shows a error message to the Third Party, which is invited to re-insert the data or to specify the missing data.
