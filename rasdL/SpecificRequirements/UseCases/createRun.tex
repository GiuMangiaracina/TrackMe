Every Organizator can create a new run, specifing the start and finish locations, date, time and the maximum number of enrollments.

                                            \item The \emph{Organizator} inserts all the required informations to define the run (start and finish locations, date, time and maximum number of partecipants)
                                             \item The \emph{Organizator} defines the list of intermediate locations that will be part of the run's path
                                            \item The System adds the new run into the list of scheduled runs

                                            \item The \emph{Organizator} specified intermediate points not reachable on foot.
                                             \item The \emph{Organizator} specified a negative maximum number of partecipants.
                                            \item The \emph{Organizator} specified a date or time that is already passed or the current day.
                                            \item The \emph{Organizator} specified a run with all the same informations of another run.
                                          \end{enumerate}
    										If one of these problems occur, the system shows an error message to the user, which is invited to re-insert the required informations for creating a new run.\\
