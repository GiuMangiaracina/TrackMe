 \subsection{Visualize the list of scheduled runs}
Into the page of \emph{Track4Run} a User can perform a manual search specifying the characteristics (location range and minimum/maximum distance) of the scheduled runs that wants to visualize. Then the System will show the list of scheduled runs that meet the User's specifications.
