 \subsection{Request of selected data of a specific user with subscription, and data visualization}
 
The third part can exploit the Data4Help System, sending a request for the selected data (health data and location) of a specific user, either the last available data, or in subscription mode.  
 In the latter case  it inserts the interval time, i.e. how often wants to receive the updates of these data.
The user can manage his requests, and decide to accept or deny them. If the request is authorized, the third party receives the requested data from the system, according to the chosen modalities.
