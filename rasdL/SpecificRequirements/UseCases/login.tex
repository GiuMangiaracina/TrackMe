                                            \item The System registers the new Registered User and sends a confirmation email to the provided email address.
                                            \item The \emph{Visitor} becomes a \emph{Registered user} inserting a unique username and the password in the log in page.  
                                            \item The \emph{Registered User} now can access the \emph{TrackMe} services through the log in page.
                                            \item After the insertion of the identifier and password, the \emph{Registered User} becomes a \emph{Logged-in User}.

                                          	\item The \emph{Registered User} is not able to sign into the System because the login data are wrong or he did not confirm the registration.
                                            \end{enumerate}
    										If one of these problems occur, the system, both on the web site and on the mobile application, shows a message error to the User/Third Party, which is invited to re-insert their credentials or confirm the registration email.\\
