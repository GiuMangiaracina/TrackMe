\subsection{Software Interfaces}
The system will need:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A client database to store data in the User’s device, so that in case of lack of     connection the data are not lost.
    \item A server database that will store the User data history and allow to retrieve the     data through queries.
    \item A mobile application that will be dowloaded on the User’s devices (both on             smartwatch and smartphone).
    \item A web application usable from a modern browser that provides access to TrackME services for the Third Party.
\end{itemize}
