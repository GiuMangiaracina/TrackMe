\subsection{Software Interfaces}
The system will need:
\begin{itemize}
\item A client database to store data in the user’s device, so that in case of lack of connection the data are not lost.

\item A server database that will store the user data history and allow to retrieve the data through queries.
\item A mobile application that will be installed on the user’s devices (both on smartwatch and smartphone)
\item A web application usable from a modern browser that provides access for the third party
\end{itemize}
